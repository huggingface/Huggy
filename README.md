## Aknowledgments

Huggy is a Deep Reinforcement Learning environment made by Hugging Face and based on [Puppo the Corgi](https://blog.unity.com/technology/puppo-the-corgi-cuteness-overload-with-the-unity-ml-agents-toolkit), a project by the Unity MLAgents team. This environment was created using the Unity game engine and MLAgents. **ML-Agents is a toolkit for the game engine from Unity that allows us to create environments using Unity or use pre-made environments to train our agents**.
